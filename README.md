# Day-5-of-Learning-Java
In the day 5 I have learn about the EXCEPTION HANDLING and made programs based on problems { Handling the exception using try-catch block, Handling a NullPointerException, Writing data to a text file using FileWriter, Defining a user-defined exception AgeNotValidException, Simulating a bank transaction  exception InsufficientFundsException }.
